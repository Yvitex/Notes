We could see there are 2 kinds of Ip addresses in the console. First is the inet or the IP v 4 and another is the inet6 which is the IP v 6. IP v 4 are written in decimal notation and IP v 6 was written in hexadecimal notation. In calculation, IP v 4 consist of 32 bits/8 bytes of data, 8 bits per parts such as (8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 32), 2 ^ 32 = 4,294,967,296 ip addresses which is not enough compared to 7 or 8 billions of device users in earth. Therefore, they created the IP v 6 which combinations ranges to the maximum of 2 ^ 128 = &nbsp;3.4028236692093846346337460743177e+38.<br/>
<br/>
Though, IP v 6 are oftenly unused because Ip v 4 have 2 types, public and private addresses. <br/>

Private address often starts with 10, 172, and 192.168. Each device has its own private address and through our ISP or internet service provider, we integrate those private address into one public address that can communicate accross the interweb. As the No of networks increase, the no of host decreases in the private address. <br/>

IP address exist at layer 3. <br/>
