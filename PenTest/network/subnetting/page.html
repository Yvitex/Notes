<br/>
The most commont subnetting network used in household is the /24 (whack 24) network, it has the value of 255.255.255.0. Each placement consist of 8 bits, 255 is the result of each bit having their switch on. <br/>

<br/>
This is called /24 because of the amount of 1's in the bits of data which is (8 + 8 + 8 + 0 = 24). The number of host in this kind of subnet is 2 ^ n, where n is the amount of zeroes, in our standard case, 2 ^ 8 = 256 host, easy computation is by taking the 32 &nbsp;- &nbsp;/number network, 32 - 24 = 8 &nbsp;as n. A host is <b>any hardware device that has the capability of permitting access to a network via a user interface, specialized software, network address, protocol stack, or any other means . </b>In our case, this are the number of connected device in a network.<br/>

<br/>
Here is a simple table that could do the job of identifying the subnet by whack number. each number from 1 to 32 are whack placeholder number. Host are written in decreasing order by dividing itself to 2, subnet is computed thorugh a fibonacci sequence where previous subnet value was added to the host. If your subnet is on /14, therefore, the subnet value was 252, and because it is one second row, we will only have 2 placements plus zero placeholder and the resulting value was 255.252.0.0. <br/>
<br/>
In easier terms: first row = x.0.0.0, second = 255.x.0.0, third = 255.255.x.0, fourth = 255.255.255.x. Also remember that /32 is max = 255.255.255.255<br/>
<br/>
/24 is for small businesses or for home plan. Large companies use lower whack as they need more host. <br/>
<br/>
Subnetting is about how address can we fit (host) and the mask (255.255.255.0) behind it.<br/>
<br/>
Always substract 2 to the total of the host, hence in /24 = 2 ^ 8 = 256 - 2 = 254 available host<br/>
<br/>
People refers to their network as this. 168.8.1.0/24, and we already knew that /24 contains 256 or 254 host amd has a mask of 255.255.255.0. This means we have 256 possible devices from 168.8.1.1 to 168.8.1.254<br/>
<br/>
In 10.1.0.0/16 has 255.255.0.0, 2 of the zeroes are free gain and the probable host is equivalent to 2 ^ 16 = 65,536. It can be a host from 10.1.0.1 to 10.1.1.254 which is 256 ^ 2 = 65,536 - 2<br/>
<br/>
So why do we always substract it into 2, because of the network and broadcast id that will take up (network id = 10.1.0.0, and broadcast id = 10.1.255.255) or if 168.8.1.0 /24, then, <br/>
(network id = 192.168.1.0 and broadcast id = 192.168.1.255)<br/>
<br/>
For 192.168.1.0 /28, then network id = 192.168.1.0 and broadcast id = 192.168.1.15 as the total number of host is 16 but the available host we can use is only 14.<br/>
<br/>
For 192.168.1.16 /28, then network id = 192.168.1.16 and broadcast id = 192.168.1.31 still having 16 total host. &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
For 192.168.0.0 /23, the subnet would be 255.255.254.0, &nbsp;the number of available host is 510,network id will be 192.168.0.0 and the broadcast id will be 192.168.1.255, the 1 represents a new network so basically it is 256 + 256 &nbsp;= 510 + 2 host<br/>
